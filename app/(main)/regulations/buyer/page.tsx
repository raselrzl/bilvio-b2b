      In case of any changes to these Terms and Conditions the Operator shall
      inform the Users of this fact with use of the Bilvio Platform. The amended
      Terms and Conditions come into force starting from the date indicated in
      amendment thereof, no earlier than 7 days after the date of announcement
      thereof by the Operator, with the reservation that any changes of a
      technical and informative nature or changes that do not result in the
      worsening of a situation of the Users may take place quicker. The offers
      which are accepted prior to the new Terms and Conditions coming into force
      are implemented according to the previous Terms and Conditions. The
      amended Terms and Conditions are binding for any registered User who has
      not terminated the agreement for having an Account kept on the Bilvio
      Platform prior to the date of amended Terms and Conditions coming into
      force.

      For statistical purposes and in order to provide the highest possible
      quality of service the Operator takes advantage of information saved by
      the server on the end device of the User, which is then read after each
      web browser connection (i.e. cookie files). The purpose of that is to
      facilitate browsing during the subsequent visit to the website. The User
      decides themselves which cookies are saved and how through the settings of
      their web browser (those commonly used include Mozilla Firefox, Internet
      Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and Microsoft Edge). The default
      settings of web browsers enable the storage of cookie files. The complete
      rules of using cookie files are specified in Attachment No. 2.

      implementation of the agreement. The party who has experienced
      difficulties in the implementation of the agreement due to force majeure
      is obliged to immediately inform the other party about this fact. Failure
      to notify or delay in notifying the other party of the occurrence of force
      majeure shall result in that party not being able to effectively invoke
      force majeure as a reason for exemption from liability or improper
      performance of the agreement.
